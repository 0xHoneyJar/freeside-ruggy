## [0.10.1] — 2026-05-01 — scope digest tool-architecture to digest workflow

<details open>
<summary>still-faking diagnosis</summary>

### Fixed

- **persona**: scope digest tool-architecture to digest workflow (#9)

_Source: PR #9_


## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-01 — environment substrate (Phases B-E · cycle-001)


Cycle-001 (V0.7-A.1 environment substrate) — closes the operator's "ChatGPT-natural tool use" gap. Three layers compose:

- **Substrate awareness** (Phases B–C): channel↔zone reverse map + environment context builder + rosenzu's moment-half (place + moment lens via `read_room` tool)
- **Tooled chat** (Phase D · MEDIUM-risk): chat-mode replies now flow through orchestrator with per-character MCP scope when conditions allow; CHAT_MODE env flag for revert

### Added

- **V0.7-A.1**: environment substrate (Phases B-E · cycle-001) (#6)
- **loa**: mount loa framework on freeside-characters

## [0.6.0-C reconciliation] — 2026-04-30

### Cabal-rotation retirement + satoshi/ruggy voice rewrite per gumi corrections

Reconciles V0.6-A → V0.6-C draft work with gumi's 2026-04-29 walkthrough
feedback on issue #1. Five corrections (seed §0.5) shifted design above and
below — the design canon shifted while V0.6-D phase 1 was being built. The
substrate / civic-layer / webhook-shell infrastructure stays; voice content
and one substrate behavior (cabal-gygax subagent in compose path) needed
rework.

The five gumi corrections:

1. **Cabal archetypes are AUDIENCE postures, not character voice modes.** The
   9 cabal-gygax archetypes are for post-design RECEPTION testing — they
   simulate how players RECEIVE a locked design. Filtering them as a
   character's "moods" was a category error. Per character: pick 1-2
   archetypes anchored as identity properties (NOT rotating filters).
2. **Sparseness = precision, not syllable rationing.** Messenger ≠ terse. NO
   one-word sentences. Full thoughts with editorial stance.
3. **Three new cross-cutting doctrines** for all characters: performed silence
   > literal silence; messenger ≠ terse; hermes moves between worlds (zone
   flexibility = identity).
4. **Codex memory richer.** Satoshi knows all 33 ancestors + mercury (astrology)
   + divine trickster. Codex grail #4488 updated 2026-04-29 with mercury /
   trickster / psychopompia (commit `3793cfd8` in construct-mibera-codex).
5. **"Figure half-visible" doctrine demoted** from load-bearing voice doctrine
   to aesthetic north star.

Operator decisions on reconciliation (V0.6-A pre-work in seed):
- Cabal pick: **(a) + (c)** — anchor identity per-character + repurpose
  cabal-gygax subagent for future post-design `/cabal` reception tester
- Ruggy anchored archetypes: **Storyteller + GM** (festival NPC narrating
  arcs across zones)
- Satoshi anchored archetypes: **Veteran + Chaos-Agent** (gumi-locked)

### Changed

- `apps/character-satoshi/persona.md` — full rewrite from gumi's locked voice
  examples (issue #1 block 4):
  - Voice rules locked: "says what needs saying, no more"; full sentences
    with editorial stance; NO one-word sentences
  - Aesthetic north star (Lugano statue) demoted from load-bearing doctrine
  - Anchored archetypes: Veteran + Chaos-Agent only (other 7 culled)
  - Canonical voice example: *"the ledger has been updated. there are 47
    confirmations across 12 keys. surprising no one, the change has held."*
  - 6 post-type fragments verbatim from gumi walkthrough
  - Performed silence pattern (NOT literal silence)
  - Hermes psychopompia / mercury / divine trickster from gumi grail update
  - System prompt template strips Task → cabal-gygax dispatch
- `apps/character-satoshi/codex-anchors.md` — expanded per Correction 4: all
  33 ancestors at `construct-mibera-codex/core-lore/ancestors/`; mercury;
  divine trickster; satoshi as 5th implicit thread (PRECEDES the 33)
- `apps/character-satoshi/ledger.md` — cross-zone freedom = identity
  (Correction 3); event-driven only, no scheduled cron ("satoshi doesn't do
  bitch work" — gumi); performed silence operationalized
- `apps/character-satoshi/creative-direction.md` — restructured as locked
  reference doc with all 5 cards + sub-question answers from gumi walkthrough
- `apps/character-ruggy/persona.md` — VOICE LENS REGISTER section reworked:
  Storyteller + GM anchored as identity properties (other 7 culled); Task →
  cabal-gygax tool dispatch removed from system prompt template; voice rules
  unchanged (TTRPG-DM scene-gen + cross-zone synthesis already operationalize
  Storyteller + GM)
- `packages/persona-engine/src/orchestrator/index.ts` — `cabalGygaxAgent`
  removed from `agents` config; import removed; `Task` removed from
  `allowedTools` (no remaining consumers)
- `packages/persona-engine/src/orchestrator/cabal/gygax.ts` — file preserved
  with retirement-notice header; building block for future `/cabal`
  post-design reception tester
- `docs/MULTI-REGISTER.md` — full reframe. Cabal = audience postures (not
  character voice axis). Per-character variance comes from post-types alone +
  anchored archetype identity (NOT 6×9=54 register slots — that framing was
  the wrong shape per Correction 1). Three cross-cutting doctrines added.
  Provenance section captures the V0.6-B → V0.6-C-reconciliation evolution.

### Removed

- 9-archetype cabal rotation from per-fire compose path (substrate)
- "Sparse cadence rarely more than 3 sentences" + "one true thing, stops" as
  literal voice rules (satoshi)
- "Figure half-visible" as load-bearing voice doctrine (satoshi — demoted to
  aesthetic north star)
- One-word sentence examples from satoshi voice rules
- Restrictive zone-affinity table for satoshi (cross-zone is identity now)
- 6×9=54 register-slots framing from MULTI-REGISTER.md

### Verified

- `bun run typecheck` clean across both packages
- `CHARACTERS=ruggy STUB` digest:once correct
- `CHARACTERS=satoshi STUB` digest:once correct (satoshi's persona.md fragments
  parse with gumi's verbatim canonical examples)

### Pending downstream

- gumi codex-side fix for the dead irys URL in grail #4488 (operator noted
  2026-04-30: "irys is dead I can upload it though")
- Avatar wiring: ruggy.png + satoshi.png from operator's `~/Desktop/constructs banner/`
  → upload to stable HTTPS endpoint → set `webhookAvatarUrl` in each
  `apps/character-<id>/character.json`
- `/cabal` command implementation (post-design audience reception tester) —
  V0.7+ scope; cabalGygaxAgent code preserved for then

## [0.6.0-D phase 1] — 2026-04-30

### Webhook-shell delivery primitive (Pattern B)

Substrate gains the canonical multi-identity Discord pattern: ONE Discord application
acts as the runtime shell hosting N characters via per-channel webhooks with
per-message `username` + `avatar_url` override. Per Eileen's `puruhani-as-spine.md`
canon: *"the Discord App becomes the interface/runtime shell."* Reference
implementation: PluralKit's "Members within Systems" model.

Doctrinal alignment AND operational survival — the shell pattern is the only
architecture that survives Discord's hard 50-bot-per-guild ceiling, established by
gemini deep research dig 2026-04-30. Pattern A (one app per character) hits the
ceiling at N=51; Pattern B scales infinitely within one shell.

### Added
- `packages/persona-engine/src/deliver/webhook.ts` — webhook delivery primitive.
  `getOrCreateChannelWebhook(client, channelId)` is idempotent (fetch by name + bot
  owner, create if missing). `sendViaWebhook(webhook, character, payload)` puppets
  per-character identity with `username` + `avatarURL` override.
  `invalidateWebhookCache()` for "unknown webhook" recovery (admin deletes via UI).
- `CharacterConfig` extended with `webhookAvatarUrl?` and `webhookUsername?` fields.
  Target URL hierarchy per SDD §0.2 + operator pick:
  `https://assets.0xhoneyjar.xyz/freeside-characters/<id>/avatar.png`.
  Until that CDN cycle reaches `/freeside-characters/`, any stable HTTPS URL works.
- `apps/bot/src/character-loader.ts` reads new fields from `character.json`.
- DEPLOY.md fully rewritten for Pattern B shape — 1 bot account · 2 services
  (prod-ruggy on main · staging-shell on staging hosting BOTH characters).
  OAuth permission update documented (`MANAGE_WEBHOOKS` required).

### Changed
- `deliverZoneDigest(config, character, zone, payload)` — now takes character.
  Delivery priority: webhook-shell → bot.send (when no webhookAvatarUrl) →
  legacy webhook fallback → dry-run.
- `DeliveryResult.via` gains `'webhook-shell' | 'webhook-fallback'` values.
- Dry-run banner now per-character: `── ruggy · stonehenge · DRY-RUN`.
- Repo description updated to `one shell, many speakers · discord persona umbrella for the honey jar`.
- README on main retitled with branch-state callout pointing to staging for V0.6+.

### Verified
- `bun run typecheck` clean across both packages.
- `CHARACTERS=ruggy STUB` digest:once → dry-run banner per-character correct.
- `CHARACTERS=satoshi STUB` digest:once → same.
- Pattern B path falls back gracefully to bot.send when `webhookAvatarUrl` is null.

### Deferred to V0.6-D phase 2 (post-observation iteration)
- `apps/bot/src/router.ts` — Gateway message listener + content-name parser.
  Design question: when satoshi is mentioned, what does he POST? Probably a new
  compose path that accepts user-message context.
- `apps/bot/src/reaction-handler.ts` — PluralKit-canonical ❓ reaction protocol.
  React ❓ to a webhook post → DM the reactor with the true author identity +
  codex anchor.
- Per-webhook burst queue with token-bucket + `Retry-After` header parsing for
  the 5-requests-per-2-seconds rate limit.
- File-based JSONL memory v1 with 4-way matrix (human↔agent · agent→world ·
  world→agent · agent↔agent). Cross-character read for ruggy → satoshi reference.

### Operator action required before staging deploy
- Grant `MANAGE_WEBHOOKS` to the ruggy bot (re-invite via OAuth URL OR per-channel
  permission grant in guild settings).
- Upload character avatars to a stable HTTPS endpoint (S3, GitHub raw, or Discord
  CDN). Until `assets.0xhoneyjar.xyz/freeside-characters/<id>/avatar.png` is live,
  a temp URL works.
- Set `webhookAvatarUrl` in each `apps/character-<id>/character.json` once
  uploaded.

### Known sidenote
- Irys URL `gateway.irys.xyz/7rpvw.../satoshi.png` is dead per operator 2026-04-30.
  Codex grail #4488 references this URL; needs codex-side fix when fresh upload
  lands at canonical path.

## [0.6.0-A] — 2026-04-29

### Substrate extraction — civic-layer split

Pulls the system-agent layer (cron, MCP orchestration, Discord delivery, score-mcp client,
persona+exemplar loading) out of `apps/bot/src` into a dedicated workspace package
`@freeside-characters/persona-engine`. Characters become participation-agent profiles
under `apps/character-<id>/` (markdown + JSON only, no runtime code). The bot shrinks
to a thin character-loader + dispatch entry.

Honors Eileen's civic-layer doctrine (`agent-native-civic-architecture.md`,
`puruhani-as-spine.md`): system agents (governors) and participation agents (speakers)
must not blur. Boundary enforced via package imports, filesystem ownership, and the
`CharacterConfig` type contract.

### Added
- `packages/persona-engine/` — substrate package with public API barrel (compose,
  schedule, deliverZoneDigest, loadConfig + types). Cabal-gygax prompt genericized
  (no longer references "ruggy" specifically).
- `apps/character-ruggy/` — Ruggy's persona profile extracted as markdown + JSON.
  Contains `character.json`, `persona.md` (was `ruggy.md`), `creative-direction.md`,
  `exemplars/`, `ledger.md`, `README.md`.
- `apps/bot/src/character-loader.ts` — filesystem reader. Reads `CHARACTERS` env
  (default `ruggy`), parses `apps/character-<id>/character.json`, returns
  `CharacterConfig[]` for substrate dispatch.
- `docs/CIVIC-LAYER.md` — load-bearing structural doctrine with violation patterns.
- `docs/CHARACTER-AUTHORING.md` — how to add a new character. Folder shape, persona.md
  conventions (system-prompt template, fragment markers, placeholders), enable via
  `CHARACTERS` env, smoke-test recipe.
- `docs/MULTI-REGISTER.md` — Eileen's same-character-different-registers doctrine, the
  6 × 9 register slot combinatorics, character-stage → daemon-stage trajectory.

### Changed
- Workspace metadata renamed: `freeside-ruggy@0.1.0` → `freeside-characters@0.6.0`
  (root); `@freeside-ruggy/bot` → `@freeside-characters/bot@0.6.0`;
  `@freeside-ruggy/protocol` → `@freeside-characters/protocol@0.6.0`. Repo on disk
  stays `freeside-ruggy` per Q1 — defer per-character repo split until experimentation
  justifies.
- Persona loader + exemplar loader now character-aware: accept `CharacterConfig`,
  cache keyed per-path / per (id, post-type). Composer / agent-gateway / orchestrator
  thread `CharacterConfig` through.
- Emojis MCP cache path: `process.cwd()/.run/emoji-recent.jsonl` (was substrate-relative;
  broke on package move).

### Verification
- `bun run typecheck` clean across `persona-engine` + `bot` packages.
- `STUB_MODE=true LLM_PROVIDER=stub` digest:once produces V0.5-E-equivalent output
  across all 4 zones (same colors, voice register, embed structure).
- `CHARACTERS=ruggy` (explicit), unset (defaults to ruggy), and unknown-id (fails loud
  with clear path-pointer error) all behave correctly.
- All file moves use `git mv` — history preserved.

### Daemon trajectory note (V0.7+, NOT V0.6 work)
Per Eileen's `puruhani-as-spine.md` canon, characters elevate to daemons when ALL of:
dNFT mint machinery + ERC-6551 token-bound accounts + state-transition handlers +
designed-voice templates + memory ledger land. Until then, character-stage with the
codex grail page (or analogous canonical text) as identity anchor is the right shape.
"freeside-daemons" terminology is intentionally NOT introduced — that vocabulary
belongs to Eileen's puruhani-daemon canon.

## [unreleased] — 2026-04-29

### Docs
- Rewrote `README.md` to reflect V0.5-E reality — superseded V1-era webhook + polling framing.
  Surfaces: persona-layer-bot positioning (vs sietch operations layer), tripartite construct
  composition (rosenzu · arneson · cabal-gygax + codex + emojis + freeside_auth + score),
  six post types + three cadences, four festival zones, the "Ruggy is one consumer of score,
  not the only one" framing, and the extractability story for sibling personas.
- Rewrote `CLAUDE.md` agent guidance — V0.5-E stack (Claude Agent SDK, in-bot MCPs,
  discord.js Gateway), construct boundaries table, "don't do" updated for the persona-layer
  invariants.
- Rewrote `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — V0.5-E architecture diagram with SDK runtime, in-bot MCPs,
  cabal-gygax subagent, arneson skill loading. Module responsibilities, dependency rules,
  swap-out matrix, future shape, and a construct-extractability checklist.
- Updated GitHub repo description + topics to surface the persona-layer + reference-implementation framing for discoverability.
- **Smol+weaver pass** (2026-04-29) — README + ARCHITECTURE.md ASCII diagrams converted to
  Mermaid (interactive on GitHub since 2022, mobile-friendly, follows the rendering-mermaid
  skill's portability rules — middle-dot inline separators, classDef vocabulary). Prose
  tightened to lowercase casual register. Repo layout collapsed into `<details>`. Construct
  table emoji-anchored. Added `construct-extractability` Mermaid for the sibling-persona
  scaffold/variable split.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- Initial scaffold (`apps/bot/` + `packages/protocol/` + `docs/`)
- Canonical persona at `apps/bot/src/persona/ruggy.md` (distilled from 5 prior repos + Discord-as-Material gemini research)
- Stub mode for local dev (`STUB_MODE=true`) — synthetic `ActivitySummary` + canned LLM digest
- Webhook-based Discord delivery (no `discord.js` dependency in V1)
- Weekly cron schedule (Sunday UTC midnight, configurable via env)
- Discord markdown sanitization (underscore escape per persona doc rules)
- Embed builder with graceful `message.content` fallback
- Persona loader that builds the system prompt from `ruggy.md`

### Architecture decisions
- V1 = polling (no NATS). When zerker's `GET /v1/activity-summary` ships, swap stub for real call.
- V1 = webhook delivery (no Gateway send, no MCI privilege required).
- V1 = no slash commands. `/ruggy digest`, `/ruggy silence` defer to V2.

### Known stubs (waiting on)
- score-api `GET /v1/activity-summary` (zerker, RFC #191)
- freeside agent-gateway integration (jani, already shipped — needs API key)
- Discord application registration + webhook URL (soju)
